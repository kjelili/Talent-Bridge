# TalentBridge — Build Documentation

## Overview

TalentBridge is a production-quality freelancing platform rebuilt as a modern React single-page application. It connects freelancers with clients, enabling job posting, bidding, team assembly, and project management.

## Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- React 18 with Hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback, useMemo)
- In-memory state management (production would use Redux/Zustand + REST API)
- CSS-in-JS with CSS custom properties (design tokens)
- DM Sans + Space Mono typography system
- Responsive design with CSS Grid and Flexbox

**File Structure:**
```
talentbridge-app.jsx    — Complete single-file React application
```

In production, this would decompose into:
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar.jsx
│   ├── Footer.jsx
│   ├── Toast.jsx
│   └── common/          (Button, Input, Card, Badge, Avatar)
├── pages/
│   ├── Landing.jsx
│   ├── Login.jsx
│   ├── Register.jsx
│   ├── Dashboard.jsx
│   ├── Freelancers.jsx
│   ├── Jobs.jsx
│   ├── PostJob.jsx
│   ├── Projects.jsx
│   └── About.jsx
├── store/               (state management)
├── hooks/               (custom hooks)
├── utils/               (helpers, formatters)
└── styles/              (design tokens, global CSS)
```

## Security Considerations

The original Flask app had:
- CSRF protection via Flask-WTF
- Password hashing with PBKDF2-SHA256
- Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Security headers (XSS, HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Input sanitization

For production React deployment, implement:
- JWT authentication with refresh tokens
- API rate limiting
- Input sanitization on both client and server
- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy headers
- CORS configuration

## Demo Accounts

| Role | Email | Password |
|------|-------|----------|
| Freelancer | sarah@example.com | Password123 |
| Freelancer | john@example.com | Password123 |
| Client | alex@techcorp.com | Password123 |
| Client | maria@startup.io | Password123 |

## Key Interactions

1. **Register as Freelancer** → Add skills → Browse jobs → Place bid
2. **Register as Client** → Post job → Review bids → Create project → Assemble team
3. **Browse talent** → View profiles → Filter by skill/search
4. **Project workflow** → Create project → Select team members (up to 4) → Track progress

## Accessibility

- Semantic HTML structure
- Color contrast meeting WCAG AA
- Focus management on navigation
- Touch-friendly targets (min 44px)
- Form labels and validation messages
- Screen reader friendly status badges

## Performance

- Single file, no external API calls in demo
- CSS animations over JavaScript where possible
- Memoized computed values (useMemo)
- Callback stability (useCallback)
- Conditional rendering for modals/forms
